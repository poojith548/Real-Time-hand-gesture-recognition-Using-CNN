# 🤖 Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture recognition system using *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)* and *OpenCV*. The system is capable of detecting and classifying hand gestures from live webcam input and mapping them to specific actions or labels.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time gesture recognition via webcam
- Custom CNN model trained on hand gesture dataset
- Preprocessing pipeline: grayscale, thresholding, contour extraction
- Easy-to-train and extend to new gestures
- Modular and clean codebase for integration with other applications

## 🧠 Model Architecture

A simple CNN architecture used:

Input (64x64 grayscale)
→ Conv2D + ReLU
→ MaxPooling
→ Conv2D + ReLU
→ MaxPooling
→ Flatten
→ Dense + ReLU
→ Dropout
→ Output (Softmax)

## 📁 Dataset

We used a custom dataset of hand gestures with 5–10 gesture classes:
- ✋ Palm
- 👊 Fist
- 👍 Thumbs Up
- 👎 Thumbs Down
- 👉 Point
- 🤟 Love/Spiderman

You can create your own dataset using the dataset_creator.py script included.
